## Overview:
#### Throughout this weeks module the purpose was to learn what sqlite is and how to use it. During this challenge the goal was to compare take the temperatures for both the month of December and the month of June. Additionally, the assignmment was to have each month have it's own data frame.
## Results:
- When looking at the average temperature for both the month of June and December there is a diiference with June having an average temp of 74.94 degrees and December having an average of 71.04 degrees.
- June also has a max temperature of 85 degrees while December has a max temperature of 83. degrees.
- June has min temperature of 65 degrees and December has a min temperature of 56 degrees.
## Summary:
#### Overall we can tell the June has higher a temperature than December throughout the different years. Another examples of some queries that could be created are one that look a specific year for both June and december. So I created those queries and put each one into its one data frame. Additionally, I used the describe function to find the statistics for each month in the year 2011.
